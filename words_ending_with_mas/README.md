 Compiles a list of all the Bengali words that end with the syllable "‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∏" (mas)

## What?

Bengali is a language spoken by over 220 million people and is also my mother language. This

## Why?

Just because I saw this in a facebook post that said to type one bengali word that that ends with the syllable "‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∏" and I got the idea of why not generate a whole list of words that that end with the syllable "‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∏". So here it is. This didn't take that long, probably like 5 minutes.

## How?

So I got a list of all the Bengali words from [MinhasKamal/BengaliDictionary](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/BengaliDictionary) (ü§ç Thanks Minhas Kamal) and then wrote a script that goes through each line in the text file and then if the line ends with "‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∏" then it save that line to the output file. Pretty simple.

## Installation

There's really no dependencies for this, just download the repository as a zip file then extract it to your desired folder. Then run the script.py file with your desired method of running python code and then it'll generate a output.txt file given there weren't any at the beginning

## Usage

Just run the python file.
