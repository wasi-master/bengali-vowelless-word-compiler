 Compiles a list of all the Bengali words without vowels

## What?

Bengali is a language spoken by over 220 million people and is also my mother language. This repository contains a word list of all bengali words and this folder contains a script that generates a list of the words that do not contain vowels. This is possible because in bengali, vowel-less words generally make the O sound, so mn would mean mon and lbn would mean lobon.

## Why?

Just because I saw this in a facebook post that said to type one bengali word that doesn't contain a vowel and I got the idea of why not generate a whole list of words that do not contain a vowel. So here it is. This didn't take that long, probably like 5 minutes.

## How?

So I got a list of all the Bengali words from [MinhasKamal/BengaliDictionary](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/BengaliDictionary) (ü§ç Thanks Minhas Kamal) and then wrote a script that goes through each line in the text file and then if the line does not contain any vowel then it save that line to the output file. Pretty simple.

## Installation

There's really no dependencies for this, just download the repository as a zip file then extract it to your desired folder. Then run the script.py file with your desired method of running python code and then it'll generate a output.txt file given there weren't any at the beginning

## Usage

Just run the python file.
